      p Instructions then, else and end should not be followed by a semicolon.
      p Instruction if accepts two conditions. Equals "=" which checks if values compared are equal and less than "<" which checks if first value in comparation is less then the second value in comparation.
      p If you wish to check if the given variable is negative you would use the following code:
      code if x < 0 then
